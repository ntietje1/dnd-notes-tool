## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntietje1/dnd-notes-tool
cd dnd-notes-tool
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Convex Setup (it will prompt you to log into [Convex](https://convex.dev) and create a project.)

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

4. Obtain your Authorization callback URL
   - In your Convex project, go to Settings > URL & Deploy Key > Show development credentials > HTTP Actions URL
   - The full Authorization callback URL will be your actions URL plus `api/auth/callback/github`.
   - So if your actions URL is `https://fast-horse-123.convex.site` then your callback URL will be: `https://fast-horse-123.convex.site/api/auth/callback/github`
5. GitHub OAuth Setup
   - Create a GitHub OAuth app, supplying your Authorization callback URL
   - Generate your client secret, copy it
   - Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:
     - `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`
     - `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`

6. Generate JWT private key:

```bash
npx @convex-dev/auth
node setup.mjs
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
